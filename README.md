Created in April 2023 - a simple script that would prompt a fine-tuned model based on my X posts with the OpenAI API, and then post using the X API. This was a simple project solely to receive silly, funny results.

For a month or two, this script ran hourly via a Cron job on GitHub Actions. I took it down as I didn't read them often and didn't need that OpenAI bill.

This was rudimentary, but gave me some basic experience working with public APIs and scheduling tasks to run. And get this - I never even leaked my API keys!
